### PCA for Face Recognition
Eigenfaces â€” Face Classification 

This program is based on the Medium article [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/eigenfaces-face-classification-in-python-7b8d2af3d3ea), which applies PCA to a face recognition problem in a way to:

- Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset,
- Keeping only the components that explain the most variance,
- Applying SVM as a simple classification algorithm to do the classification task.
